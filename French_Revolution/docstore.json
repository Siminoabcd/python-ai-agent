in\nNovember 1799French Revolution\nThe French Revolution[a] was a period of political and societal\nchange in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 ,\nand ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire in November 1799 and\nthe formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are\nconsidered funda mental principles of liberal democracy,[1] while\nits values and institutions remain central to modern French\npolitical discourse.[2]\nIts causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social,\npolitical and econom ic factors, which the Ancien R\u00e9gime proved\nunable to manage. A financial crisis and widespread social\ndistress led, in May 1789, to the convoc ation of the Estates\nGeneral which was conve rted into a National Assembly in June.\nThe Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical\nmeasures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of\nfeudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and\na declaration of  rights.\nThe next three years were dominated by the struggle for political\ncontrol, exacerbated by econom ic depression. Military defeats\nfollowing the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in\nApril 1792  resulted in the Insurrection of 10 Augus t 1792 . The\nmonarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First\nRepublic in September, while Louis XVI was executed in\nJanuary 1793.\nAfter another revolt in June 1793 , the constitution was suspended\nand effective political power passed from the National\nConve ntion to the Committee of Public Safety. About 16,000\npeople were executed in a Reign of Terror, which ended in July\n1794 . Weakened by external threats and internal oppos ition, the\nRepublic was replaced in 1795 by the Directory. Four years later\nin 1799, the Consulate seized power in a military coup led by\nNapoleon Bonaparte. This is generally seen as marking the end\nof the Revolutionary period.\nThe Revolution was the result of multiple long-term and short-\nterm factors that culminated in a social, econom ic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s .[3][4][5]\nCombined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite, and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his\nministers, the state was unable to manage the crisis.[6][7]Causes", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2636, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00bb585c-56ba-42a6-8ab5-19ff420def10": {"__data__": {"id_": "00bb585c-56ba-42a6-8ab5-19ff420def10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca366743-e442-4018-84a6-7a037e8bd5b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "17b94bd89f7c445fafad552557dfe1e7e7a7f7e40f95cda85fad409fa4fe55fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45d3d13e-a654-48ed-a9da-444ce34083e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "1d4a82fbbd0192f48dc126305950ac53cb087cff33936aeb545865ddd2a25d80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b17d0f33-599a-47f8-9f0f-fe2e33ccca8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57571e7491d67af381baf6f3d7f73b56f56676664481a9fa4f9d901974963e2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The regional Parlements in 1789;\nnote area covered by the Parlement\nof ParisBetween 1715 and 1789, the French popul ation grew from an estimated 21 to 28 million.[8] The proportion\nof the popul ation living in towns increased to 20%, and Paris alone had over 600,000 inhabitants.[8]\nPeasants comprised about 80% of the popul ation, but the middle classes tripled over the century, reaching\nalmost 10% of the popul ation by 1789.[9] Although the 18th century was a period of increasing prosperity,\nthe benefits were distributed unevenly across regions and social groups . Those whose income derived from\nagriculture, rents, interest and trade in goods  from France's slave colonies benefited most, while the living\nstandards of wage labourers and farmers on rented land fell.[10][11] Increasing inequality led to more social\nconflict.[12] Economic recession from 1785 and bad harvests in 1787 and 1788 led to high unemployment\nand food pr ices which coincided with a financial and pol itical crisis for the monarchy.[3][13][14][15]\nWhile the state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with\nBritain's.[16] A major problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often\ndifferent from the official amounts, and collected inconsistently. Its complexity meant uncertainty over the\namount any authorised tax actually contributed, and caused resentment among all taxpayers.[17][b] Attempts\nto simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The\nresulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates-General, which became radicalised by the struggle for\ncontrol of publ ic finances.[19]\nLouis XVI was willing to consider reforms, but often backed down when faced with oppos ition from\nconservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely\ndiscussed among the educated French elite, while the American Revolution and the European revolts of the\n1780s  inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality and the participation of the\npeople in making laws. These debates helped shape the respons e of the educated public to the crisis facing\nthe state.[20] A series of public scandals such as the Diamond Necklace Affair also fuelled popul ar anger at\nthe court, nobi lity and church officials.[21]\nThe monarchy faced a series of budge tary crises during the 18th\ncentury, as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure on the\nmilitary and state pensions.[22][23] Although  the French econom y\ngrew solidly, the tax system did not capture the new wealth.[22] Tax\ncollection was contracted to tax farmers and receivers who often\nkept much of the tax collected as personal profit. As the nobility and\nChurch benefited from many exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly\non peasants.[24] Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to\nbe registered with regional judicial bodies know n as parlements that\ncould deny registration if the laws conflicted with existing rights\nand privileges. The king could impose laws by decree but this\nrisked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility and those\nsubject to new taxes.[25]\nFrance mostly funde d the Anglo-French War of 1778\u20131783 through loans. Following the peace, the\nmonarchy continued to borrow heavily, culminating in a debt crisis. By 1788, half of state revenue was\nrequired to service its debt.[26] In 1786 the French finance minister, Calonne , propos ed a package of\nreforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial\nassemblies appointed by the king.

The notables and parlements argued that the propos ed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-\nGeneral, a representative body t hat had last met in 1614.[27]\nThe conflict between the crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a\nseries of public statements, the gove rnment arguing that it was combating privilege, the parlements that it\nwas defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side of the parlements and\nrioting broke out in several towns. Brienne's attempts to raise new loans failed, and on 8 August 1788 he\nannounc ed that the king would summon an Estates-General to conve ne the following May. Brienne\nresigned and w as replaced by Necker.[28]\nIn September 1788, the parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates-General should conve ne in the same form\nas in 1614, meaning that the three estates (the clergy, nobility and Third Estate or \"commons\") would meet\nand vote separately and votes would be counted by estate rather than by head. As a result, the clergy and\nnobility could combine to outvote the Third Estate despite representing less than 5% of the\npopul ation.[29][30]\nFollowing the relaxation of censorship and laws against political clubs, a group of liberal nobles and middle\nclass activists, know n as the Society of Thirty, launched a campaign for the doubl ing of Third Estate\nrepresentation and voting by head. The public debate saw an average of 25 new political pamphlets\npublished a week from 25 September 1788.[31] The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s issued influential pamphlets denounc ing\nthe privilege of the clergy and nobility and arguing that the Third Estate represented the nation and should\nsit alone as a National Assembly. Activists such as Mounier, Barnave and Robespierre organised meetings,\npetitions and literature on behalf of the Third Estate in regional towns.[32] In December, the king agreed to\ndoubl e the representation of the Third Estate but left the question of counting votes by head for the Estates-\nGeneral to decide.[33]\nThe Estates-General contained three separate bodies, the First Estate\nrepresenting 100,000  clergy, the Second the nobility, and the Third the\n\"commons\".[34] Since each met separately, and any propos als had to be\napproved by at least two, the First and Second Estates could outvote the\nThird despite representing less than 5%  of the popul ation.[29]\nAlthough the Catholic Church in France owned nearly 10% of all land, as\nwell as receiving annual tithes paid by peasants,[35] three-quarters of the\n303 clergy elected were parish priests, many of whom earned less than\nunskilled labourers and had more in common with their poor parishioners\nthan with the Bishops  of the first estate.[36][37]\nThe Second Estate elected 322 deputies, representing about 400,000 men\nand women, who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial\ndues and rents from their tenants.

On the following day, each estate was to separately verify the credentials of\ntheir representatives. The Third Estate, however, voted to invite the other estates to join them in verifying all\nthe representatives of the Estates-General in common and to agree that votes should be counted by head.\nFruitless negotiations lasted to 12 June when the Third Estate began verifying its own members. On 17\nJune, the Third Estate declared itself to be the National Assembly of France and that all existing taxes were\nillegal.[42] Within two days, more than 100 m embers of the clergy ha d joined them.[43]\nShaken by this challenge to his authority, the king agreed to a\nreform package that he would announc e at a Royal Session of the\nEstates-General. The Salle des \u00c9tats was closed to prepare for the\njoint session, but the members of the Estates-General were not\ninformed in advance. On 20 June, when the members of the Third\nEstate found their meeting place closed, they moved to a nearby\ntennis court and swore not to disperse until a new constitution had\nbeen agreed.[44]\nAt the Royal Session the king announc ed a series of tax and other\nreforms and stated that no new taxes or loans would be\nimplemented without the consent of the Estates-General. However,\nhe stated that the three estates were sacrosanct and it was up to each\nestate to agree to end their privileges and decide on which matters they would vote in common with the\nother estates. At the end of the session the Third Estate refused to leave the hall and reiterated their oath not\nto disperse until a constitution had been agreed. Over the next days more members of the clergy joined the\nNational Assembly. On 27 June, faced with popul ar demonstrations and mutinies in his French Guards,\nLouis XVI capitulated. He commanded the members of the first and second estates to join the third in the\nNational Assembly.[45]\nEven the limited reforms the king had announc ed went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis' younge r\nbrother the Comte d'Artois. On their advice, Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July.[46]\nOn 12 July, the Assembly went into a non-stop session after rumours circulated he was planning to use the\nSwiss Guards to force it to close. The news brought  crowds of protestors into the streets, and soldiers of the\nelite Gardes Fran\u00e7aises regiment refused to disperse them.[47]\nOn the 14th, many of these soldiers joined the mob in attacking the Bastille, a royal fortress with large\nstores of arms and ammunition. Its gove rnor, Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay, surrendered after several hours of\nfighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers. Taken to the H\u00f4tel de Ville, he was executed, his head placed on\na pike and paraded around the city; the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time. Although\nrumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, a lunatic, a failed assassin, and\na deviant nobl eman. Nevertheless, as a potent symbol of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, its destruction w as viewed as a\ntriumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year.[48] In French culture, some see its fall as the start of\nthe Revolution.[49]Constitutional monarchy (July 1789 \u2013 S eptember 1792)\nAbolition of the Ancien R\u00e9gime", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3710, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59ac5de8-0504-4fb0-9534-6f59e2cffc35": {"__data__": {"id_": "59ac5de8-0504-4fb0-9534-6f59e2cffc35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "258e103b-86c0-408b-9b39-ac614c3c4248", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "1c12fea60e53d8bab6b5db8d1b234eb4420368dcaf5c3f61acee2b286c166d5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be025e5b-af48-49af-a182-4b28db81a1a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "a3ce95af43ccd686ba0751d0ac85d436899380bfea69f5f9828bbbaa105f9196", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6aeee9e0-a0a9-48db-b854-e67690191a27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "218146bde161fb1dad9d3ad4bb9abd5758748edc2d4779b852012023dd4122d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Storming of the Bastille on 14\nJuly 1789; the iconic event of the\nRevolution, still commemorated each\nyear as Bastille DayAlarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis\nappointed the Marquis de Lafayette commander of the National\nGuard, with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative\nstructure know n as the Commune. On 17 July, Louis visited Paris\naccompanied by 100 deputies, where he was greeted by Bailly and\naccepted a tricolore cockade to loud cheers. However, it was clear\npower had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI,\nfather of the French and ki ng of  a free people.'[50]\nThe short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common\nthreat quickly dissipated. Deputies argued over constitutional forms,\nwhile civil authority rapidly deteriorated. On 22 July, former\nFinance Minister Joseph Foullon and his son were lynched by a\nParisian mob, and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it. In\nrural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of\nmilitia and an agrarian insurrection know n as la Grande  Peur.[51] The breakdow n of law and order and\nfrequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad. These \u00e9migr\u00e9s funded\nreactionary forces within France and ur ged foreign m onarchs to back a counter-revolution.[52]\nIn respons e, the Assembly published the August Decrees which abolished feudalism. Over 25% of French\nfarmland was subject to feudal dues, providing the nobility with most of their income; these were now\ncancelled, along with church tithes. While their former tenants were suppos ed to pay them compensation,\ncollecting it proved impossible, and the obligation was annulled in 1793.[53] Other decrees included\nequality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special\nprivileges held by pr ovinces and towns.[54]\nWith the suspension of the 13 regional parlements in November, the key institutional pillars of the old\nregime had all been abolished in less than four months. From its early stages, the Revolution therefore\ndisplayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning\nintentions into practical applications.[55]\nOn 9 July, the National Assembly appointed a committee to draft a constitution and statement of rights.[56]\nTwenty drafts were submitted, which were used by a sub-committee to create a Declaration of the Rights of\nMan and of the Citizen, with Mirabeau being the most prominent member.[57] The Declaration was\napproved by t he Assembly and publ ished on 26 August as a statement of principle.[58]\nThe Assembly now concentrated on the constitution itself. Mounier and his monarchist suppor ters\nadvoc ated a bicameral system, with an uppe r hous e appointed by t he king, w ho w ould also have the right to\nappoint ministers and veto legislation. On 10 September, the majority of the Assembly, led by Siey\u00e8s and\nTalleyrand, voted in favour of a single body , and the following day approved a \"suspensive veto\" for the\nking, meaning Louis could delay implementation of a law, but not block it indefinitely. In October, the\nAssembly voted to restrict political rights, including voting rights, to \"active citizens\", defined as French\nmales over the age of 25 who paid direct taxes equal to three days' labour. The remainder were designated\n\"passive citizens\", restricted to \"civil rights\", a distinction oppos ed by a significant minority, including the\nJacobin clubs.[59][60] By mid-1790, the main elements of a constitutional monarchy were in place, although\nthe constitution w as not accepted by L ouis until 1791.[61]Creating a new constitution", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3685, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aeee9e0-a0a9-48db-b854-e67690191a27": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aeee9e0-a0a9-48db-b854-e67690191a27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35949f3a-e6c0-4fb0-ad4f-3dfa4aaf0a3c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "93c962951322dda07ca833692463cb5f51d646ccca4027773e1ad646ff805f7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "59ac5de8-0504-4fb0-9534-6f59e2cffc35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "1c12fea60e53d8bab6b5db8d1b234eb4420368dcaf5c3f61acee2b286c166d5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6a9dd18-3cc6-41be-86cd-074b007c8f17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13dca60e3a1793ebe94a49cba3ab5123148b354dd4653f71fa1e6a31c9a3de32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In this caricature, monks and nuns\nenjoy their new freedom after the\ndecree of 16 February 1790.Food shortages and the worsening econom y caused frustration at the lack of progress, and led to popul ar\nunrest in Paris.

The radical press described this as a 'gluttonous  orgy', and claimed the tricolour cockade had been\nabused, while the Assembly viewed their arrival as an attempt to intimidate them.[62]\nOn 5 October, crowds of women assembled outside the H\u00f4tel de Ville, agitating against high food prices\nand shortages.[63] These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons  stored at the H\u00f4tel de\nVille, some 7,000 of them marched on Versailles, where they entered the Assembly to present their\ndemands.

Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments,\nsearching for Marie Antoinette, who escaped. They ransacked the palace, killing several guards. Order was\neventually restored, and the Royal family and A ssembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard.[65]\nLouis had announc ed his acceptance of the Augus t Decrees and the Declaration, and his official title\nchanged from 'King of  France' to 'King of  the French'.[66]\nHistorian John McManners argues \"in eighteenth-century France, throne and altar were commonly spoke n\nof as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their\ninterdependence.\" One sugge stion is that after a century of persecution, some French Protestants actively\nsuppor ted an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire.[67]\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, considered a philosophical founde r of the revolution,[68][69][70] wrote it was\n\"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with\nsuperfluities, while the hungr y multitude goes in want of necessities.\"[71]\nThe Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic\nChurch to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been\nquestioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant\nby 1789 being French also meant being Catholic.[72] The church\nwas the largest individual landow ner in France, controlling nearly\n10% of all estates and levied tithes, effectively a 10% tax on\nincome, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops. In\nreturn, it provided a minimal level of social suppor t.[73]\nThe Augus t decrees abolished tithes, and on 2 November the\nAssembly confiscated all church property, the value of which was\nused to back a new paper currency know n as assignats. In return,\nthe state assumed respons ibilities such as paying the clergy and\ncaring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned.[74] On 13 February\n1790, religious orders and monasteries were dissolved, while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to\nprivate life.[75]\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state, as well as\nestablishing rates of pay and a system for electing priests and bishops .

However, conflict over the source of legitimate\nauthority was more apparent in the provinces, where officers of the Ancien R\u00e9gime had been swept away,\nbut not yet replaced by new structures. This was less obvious in Paris, since the National Guard made it the\nbest policed city in Europe, but disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly.[79]\nCentrists led by Siey\u00e8s, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a\nmajority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier, and\nindependents including Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre\nLameth. At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like\nCazal\u00e8s and Maury denounc ed the Revolution in all its forms, with\nradicals like Maximilien Robespierre at the other. He and Jean-Paul\nMarat oppos ed the criteria for \"active citizens\", gaining them\nsubstantial suppor t among the Parisian proletariat, many of whom\nhad been disenfranchised by t he measure.[80]\nOn 14 July 1790, celebrations were held throughout  France\ncommemorating the fall of the Bastille, with participants swearing\nan oath of fidelity to \"the nation, the law and the king.\" The F\u00eate de\nla F\u00e9d\u00e9ration in Paris was attended by the Royal family, with Talleyrand performing a mass. Despite this\nshow of unity, the Assembly was increasingly divided, while external players like the Paris Commune and\nNational Guard competed for power. One of the most significant was the Jacobin club; originally a forum\nfor general debate, by Augus t 1790 i t had ove r 150 m embers, split into different factions.[81]\nThe Assembly continued to develop new institutions; in September 1790, the regional Parlements were\nabolished and their legal functions replaced by a new independent judiciary, with jury trials for criminal\ncases. However, moderate deputies were uneasy at popul ar demands for universal suffrage, labour unions\nand cheap bread, and ove r the winter of 1790 a nd 1791, t hey passed a series of measures intended to disarm\npopul ar radicalism. These included exclusion of poorer citizens from the National Guard, limits on use of\npetitions and pos ters, and the June 1791 Le Chapelier Law suppressing trade guilds and any form of worker\norganisation.[82]\nThe traditional force for preserving law and order was the army, which was increasingly divided between\nofficers, who largely came from the nobility, and ordinary soldiers. In Augus t 1790, the loyalist General\nBouill\u00e9 suppressed a serious mutiny at Nancy; although c ongratulated by t he Assembly, he was criticised by\nJacobin radicals for the severity of his actions.

Finally, poor harvests and rising food prices led to unrest among the urban class\nknow n as Sans -culottes, who saw the new regime as failing to meet their demands for bread and w ork.[91]\nThis meant the new constitution was oppos ed by significant elements inside and outside the Assembly, itself\nsplit into three main groups . 264 members were affiliated with Barnave's Feuillants, constitutional\nmonarchists who considered the Revolution had gone  far enough, while another 136 were Jacobin leftistsFall of the monarchy", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3689, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e461308-2758-4b10-a9d7-37d2cc79aa73": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e461308-2758-4b10-a9d7-37d2cc79aa73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6999eef3-18d8-4866-8ae1-1d53ddf8867d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "90d5ea39108340270fc6e5d027db0130eece0e74607f99d48dc637999dd1912e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1947c56b-3c98-425d-a5be-457a5847af6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "fcca13b6406d2638183faa20477302cd7d9effa843f801d840b0acba0850d5bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d59e56e-2062-4ed0-a704-86161c081bbd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "598af224d2d71f0227a08edc523676dfde32ebb5345007f73a9bedce67bbd8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The storming of the Tuileries Palace,\n10 August 1792who suppor ted a republic, led by Brissot and usually referred to as Brissotins.[92] The remaining 345\nbelonge d to La Plaine, a centrist faction who switched votes depending on the issue, but many of whom\nshared doubt s as to whether Louis was committed to the Revolution.[92] After he officially accepted the\nnew Constitution, one recorded respons e was \"Vive le roi, s'il est de bon foi!\", or \"Long live the king \u2013 if he\nkeeps his word\".[93]\nAlthough a minority in the Assembly, control of key committees allowed the Brissotins to provok e Louis\ninto using his veto. They first managed to pass decrees confiscating \u00e9migr\u00e9 property, and threatening them\nwith the death penalty.[94] This was followed by measures against non-juring priests, whose oppos ition to\nthe Civil Constitution led to a state of near civil war in southern France, which Bernave tried to defuse by\nrelaxing the more punitive provisions. On 29 November, the Assembly approved a decree giving refractory\nclergy eight days to comply, or face charges of 'conspiracy against the nation', an act oppos ed even by\nRobespierre.[95] When Louis vetoed both, his oppone nts were able to portray him as oppos ed to reform in\ngeneral.[96]\nBrissot accompanied this with a campaign for war against Austria\nand Prussia, often interpreted as a mixture of calculation and\nidealism. While exploiting popul ar anti-Austrianism, it reflected a\ngenuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and\npopul ar sovereignty.[97] Simultaneously, conservatives headed by\nMarie Antoinette also favoured war, seeing it as a way to regain\ncontrol of the military, and restore royal authority. In December\n1791, Louis made a speech in the Assembly giving foreign powers\na month to disband the \u00e9migr\u00e9s or face war, an act greeted with\nenthusiasm by s uppor ters, but suspicion from oppone nts.[98]\nBernave's inability to build a consensus in the Assembly resulted in\nthe appointment of a new gove rnment, chiefly composed of Brissotins. On 20 April 1792 , the French\nRevolutionary Wars began when French armies attacked Austrian and Prussian forces along their borders,\nbefore suffering a series of disastrous defeats. In an effort to mobilise popul ar suppor t, the gove rnment\nordered non-juring priests to swear the oath or be deported, dissolved the Constitutional Guard and replaced\nit with 20,000 f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s; Louis agreed to disband the Guard, but vetoed the other two proposals, while\nLafayette called on t he Assembly to suppress the clubs.[99]\nPopular anger increased when details of the Brunswick Manifesto reached Paris on 1 August, threatening\n'unforgettable vengeance' should any oppos e the Allies in seeking to restore the power of the monarchy. On\nthe morning of 10 August, a combined force of the Paris National Guard and provincial f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s attacked the\nTuileries Palace, killing many of the Swiss Guards protecting it.[100] Louis and his family took refuge with\nthe Assembly and shortly after 11:00 am, the deputies present voted to 'temporarily relieve the king',\neffectively suspending the monarchy.[101]\nIn late August, elections were held for the National Conve ntion. New restrictions on the franchise meant the\nnumber of votes cast fell to 3.3 million, versus 4 million in 1791, while intimidation was widespread.[102]\nThe Brissotins now split between moderate Girondins led by Brissot, and radical Montagnar ds, headed by\nRobespierre, Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat.

Emboldened by this, on 22 September the\nConve ntion replaced the monarchy with the French First Republic (1792\u201318 04) and introduc ed a new\ncalendar, with 1792 becoming \"Year One\".[106] The next few months were taken up with the trial of\nCitoyen Louis Capet, formerly Louis XVI. While evenly divided on the question of his guilt, members of\nthe conve ntion were increasingly influenced by radicals based within the Jacobin clubs and Paris\nCommune. The Brunswick Manifesto made it easy to portray Louis as a threat to the Revolution, especially\nwhen extracts from his personal corresponde nce showed him conspiring w ith Royalist exiles.[107]\nOn 17 January 1793, Louis was sentenced to death for \"conspiracy against public liberty and general\nsafety\". 361 deputies were in favour, 288 against, while another 72 voted to execute him, subject to\ndelaying conditions. The sentence was carried out on 21 January on the Place de la R\u00e9volution, now the\nPlace de la Concorde.[108] Conservatives across Europe now called for the destruction of revolutionary\nFrance, and in February the Conve ntion responde d by declaring war on Britain and the Dutch Republic.\nTogether with Austria and Prussia, these two countries were later joined by Spain, Portugal, Naples, and\nTuscany in the War of the First Coalition (1792\u20131797) .[109]\nThe Girondins hope d war would unite the people behind the gove rnment and provide an excuse for rising\nprices and food shortages, but found themselves the target of popul ar anger.

Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church, in March the traditionally conservative and\nroyalist Vend\u00e9e rose in revolt. On 18th, Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the\nAustrians. Uprisings followed in Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulon, Marseilles and Caen. The Republic seemed on\nthe verge of collapse.[110]\nThe crisis led to the creation on 6 April 1793 of the Committee of Public Safety, an executive committee\naccountable to the convention.[111] The Girondins made a fatal political error by indicting Marat before the\nRevolutionary Tribuna l for allegedly directing the September massacres; he was quickly acquitted, further\nisolating the Girondins from the sans-culottes. When Jacques H\u00e9bert called for a popul ar revolt against the\n\"henchmen of Louis Capet\" on 24 May, he was arrested by the Commission of Twelve, a Girondin-\ndominated tribuna l set up to expos e 'plots'.

On 17 Augus t, the Convention voted a second lev\u00e9e en masse; despite initial problems in\nequipping and supplying such large numbers, by mid-October Republican forces had re-taken Lyon,\nMarseilles and Bordeaux, while defeating Coalition armies at Hondschoote and Wattignies.[116] The new\nclass of military leaders included a young colonel named Napoleon Bonaparte, who was appointed\ncommander of artillery at the siege of Toulon thanks to his friendship with Augustin Robespierre. His\nsuccess in that role resulted in promotion to the Army of Italy in April 1794, and the beginning of his rise to\nmilitary and pol itical pow er.[117]\nAlthough intended to bolster revolutionary fervour, the Reign of\nTerror rapidly degenerated into the settlement of personal\ngrievances. At the end of July, the Conve ntion set price controls on\na wide range of goods , with the death penalty for hoarders. On 9\nSeptember, 'revolutionary groups ' were established to enforce these\ncontrols, while the Law of Suspects on 17th approved the arrest of\nsuspected \"enemies of freedom\". This initiated what has become\nknow n as the \"Terror\". From September 1793 to July 1794, around\n300,000 were arrested,[118] with some 16,600 people executed on\ncharges of counter-revolutionary activity, while another 40,000 may\nhave been summarily executed, or died awaiting trial.[119]\nPrice controls made farmers reluctant to sell their produc e in Parisian markets, and by early September, the\ncity was suffering acute food shortages. At the same time, the war increased public debt, which the\nAssembly tried to finance by selling confiscated property. However, few would buy assets that might be\nrepossessed by their former owners, a concern that could only be achieved by military victory. This meant\nthe financial position worsened as threats to the Republic increased, while printing assignats to deal with\nthe deficit further increased inflation.[120]Reign of Terror", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3507, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efc00573-2a56-424a-825c-54d424df26d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "efc00573-2a56-424a-825c-54d424df26d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07dfec21-664a-4e04-9772-2e84df72cb34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "a0e6926023f60b31bd2259a32d22cbd14cd7e29e4ef8e2327cb3a5e24a7d5b85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "214c7407-ec88-4ade-baef-3eeb142e491f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "4789622a0a3145fd29ab40312e97616afb6a7da91f76d7c9332f2ebf6a87b6c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e2ab6c8-896a-4ec1-8a28-c523fc90dd77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bef355dc00e40c854d021262aa2ca4df818cade112b72b74ed41c174784da005", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Georges Danton;\nRobespierre's close friend and\nMontagnard leader, executed\n5 April 1794\nThe execution of Robespierre on 28 July\n1794 marked the end of the Reign of\nTerror.On 10 October, the Conve ntion recognised the Committee of Public Safety as the supreme Revolutionary\nGovernment, and suspended the Constitution until peace was achieved.[114] In mid-October, Marie\nAntoinette was convicted of a long list of crimes, and guillotined; two weeks later, the Girondist leaders\narrested in June were also executed, along with Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9. The \"Terror\" was not confined to Paris,\nwith ove r 2,000 ki lled in Lyons  after its recapture.[121]\nAt Cholet on 17 October, the Republican army won a decisive victory\nover the Vend\u00e9e rebels, and the survivors escaped into Brittany. Another\ndefeat at Le Mans on 23 December ended the rebellion as a major threat,\nalthough the insurgency continued until 1796. The extent of the repression\nthat followed has been debated by French historians since the mid-19th\ncentury.[122] Between November 1793 to February 1794, over 4,000\nwere drowned in the Loire at Nantes unde r the supervision of Jean-\nBaptiste Carrier. Historian Reynald Secher claims that as many as 117,000\ndied between 1793 and 1796.

Those\narrested in the provinces were now sent to Paris for judge ment; from March to July, executions in Paris\nincreased from five to twenty-six a day.[129] Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme\nBeing on 8 June, a lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre, who was also accused of circulating\nclaims he was a second Messiah. Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing\nunrest among the sans-culottes, but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in\ndanger. Fearing their own survival depended on Robespierre's removal, on 29 June three members of the\nCommittee of Public Safety ope nly accused him of being a dictator.[130]\nRobespierre responded by refusing to attend Committee\nmeetings, allowing his oppone nts to build a coalition against\nhim.

They included Paul Barras, later chief executive of the French Directory,\nand Joseph Fouch\u00e9, director of the killings in Lyon who served as Minister of Police unde r the Directory,\nthe Consulate and Empire.[136] Despite his links to Augus tin Robespierre, military success in Italy meant\nNapoleon B onaparte escaped censure.[137]\nThe December 1794 Treaty of La Jaunaye ended the Choua nnerie in\nwestern France by allowing freedom of worship and the return of non-\njuring priests.[138] This was accompanied by military success; in January\n1795, French forces helped the Dutch Patriots set up the Batavian\nRepublic, securing their northern border.[139] The war with Prussia was\nconcluded in favour of France by the Peace of Basel in April 1795, while\nSpain made peace shortly thereafter.[140]\nHowever, the Republic still faced a crisis at home. Food shortages arising\nfrom a poor 1794 harvest were exacerbated in Northern France by the\nneed to supply the army in Flanders, while the winter was the worst since\n1709.[141] By April 1795, people were starving and the assignat was\nworth only 8% of its face value; in desperation, the Parisian poor rose\nagain.[142] They were quickly dispersed and the main impact was another\nround of arrests, while Jacobin prisoners in Lyon were summarily\nexecuted.[143]\nA committee drafted a new constitution, approved by plebiscite on 23\nSeptember 1795 and put into place on 27th.[144] Largely designed by\nPierre Daunou and Boissy d'Anglas, it established a bicameral legislature,\nintended to slow down the legislative process, ending the wild swings of policy unde r the previous\nunicameral systems. The Counc il of 500 was responsible for drafting legislation, which was reviewed and\napproved by the Counc il of Ancients, an uppe r house containing 250 men over the age of 40. Executive\npower was in the hands of five Directors, selected by the Counc il of Ancients from a list provided by the\nlower hous e, with a five-year mandate.[145]Thermidorian reaction", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3540, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed310497-e1b3-4a03-a940-1c53a688745a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed310497-e1b3-4a03-a940-1c53a688745a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a209bcdb-14f3-4d9e-afa0-42d89f0ae015", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "09294def4a01fa34f06adc0d98ee5de8dcd261e8f353c2ebb5229c1de1c2023b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e2ab6c8-896a-4ec1-8a28-c523fc90dd77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "27845583c6e4a652246a095f5febf6b9a8241069f80116eaaed23858148f4de6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "697c236f-ce37-4ec9-8fed-f1b74aec926d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7eb574478ac7fad43d3451a28ec3512f08b3695720af17b1dd9000b7c07459e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Troops under Napoleon fire on\nRoyalist insurgents in Paris, 5\nOctober 1795Deputies were chosen by indirect election, a total franchise of around 5 million voting in primaries for\n30,000 electors, or 0.6%  of the popul ation. Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification,\nit guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies. In addition, rather than dissolving the\nprevious legislature as in 1791 and 1792, the so-called 'law of two-thirds' ruled only 150 new deputies\nwould be elected each year. The remaining 600 Conventionne ls kept their seats, a move intended to ensure\nstability.[146]\nJacobin sympathisers viewed the Directory as a betrayal of the\nRevolution, while Bonapartists later justified Napoleon's coup by\nemphasising its corruption.[147] The regime also faced internal\nunrest, a weak economy, and an expensive war, while the Counc il\nof 500 could block legislation at will. Since the Directors had no\npower to call new elections, the only way to break a deadlock was\nrule by decree, or use force. As a result, the Directory was\ncharacterised by \"chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and\nrepeated recourse to heavy-handed repression.\"[148]\nRetention of the Conventionne ls ensured the Thermidorians held a\nmajority in the legislature and three of the five Directors, but they\nwere increasingly challenged by the right.

Led by the revolutionary Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf, their demands included\nimmediate implementation of the 1793 Constitution, and a more equitable distribution of wealth. Despite\nsuppor t from sections of the military, the revolt was easily crushed, while Babeuf and other leaders were\nexecuted.[151] Nevertheless, by 1799 the econom y had been stabilised, and important reforms made\nallowing steady expansion of French indus try. Many of these remained in place for much of the 19th\ncentury.[152]\nPrior to 1797, three of the five Directors were firmly Republican; Barras, R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux and Jean-\nFran\u00e7ois Rewbell, as were around 40% of the legislature. The same percentage were broadly centrist or\nunaffiliated, along with two Directors, \u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Letourneur and Lazare Carnot. Although  only 20%\nwere committed Royalists, many centrists suppor ted the restoration of the exiled Louis XVIII of France in\nthe belief this would bring peace.[153] The elections of May 1797 resulted in significant gains for the right,\nwith Royalists Jean-Charles Pichegru elected President of the Counc il of 500, and Barth\u00e9lemy appointed a\nDirector.[154]\nWith Royalists apparently on the verge of power, Republicans attempted a pre-emptive coup on 4\nSeptember. Using troops from Napoleon's Army of Italy under Pierre Augereau, the Council of 500 was\nforced to approve the arrest of Barth\u00e9lemy, Pichegru and Carnot. The elections were annulled, sixty-three\nleading Royalists deported to French Guiana, and new laws passed against \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Royalists and ultra-\nJacobins.

Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in\nJuly 1798 confirmed European fears of French expansionism, and the War\nof the Second Coalition began in November. Without a majority in the\nlegislature, the Directors relied on the army to enforce decrees, and extract\nrevenue from conque red territories. Generals like Napoleon and Joube rt\nwere now central to the political process, while both the army and\nDirectory became notorious for their corruption.[156]\nIt has been sugge sted the Directory collapsed because by 1799, many\n'preferred the uncertainties of authoritarian rule to the continuing\nambiguities of parliamentary politics'.[157] The architect of its end was\nSiey\u00e8s, who when asked what he had done  during the Terror allegedly\nanswered \"I survived\". Nominated to the Directory, his first action was to\nremove Barras, with the help of allies including Talleyrand, and\nNapoleon's brother Lucien, President of the Counc il of 500.[158] On 9\nNovember 1799, the Coup of 18 Brumaire replaced the five Directors with the French Consulate, which\nconsisted of three members, Napoleon, Siey\u00e8s, and Roger Ducos. Most historians consider this the end\npoint of the French Revolution.[159]\nThe role of ideology in the Revolution is controversial with Jonathan Israel stating that the \"radical\nEnlightenment\" was the primary driving force of the Revolution.[160] Cobba n, however, argues \"[t]he\nactions of the revolutionaries were most often prescribed by t he need to find pr actical solutions to immediate\nproblems, using the resources at hand, not  by pr e-conceived theories.\"[161]\nThe identification of ideologies is complicated by the profusion of revolutionary clubs, factions and\npublications, absence of formal political parties, and individual flexibility in the face of changing\ncircumstances.[162] In addition, a lthough t he Declaration of  the Rights of Man was a funda mental document\nfor all revolutionary factions, its interpretation va ried widely.[163]\nWhile all revolutionaries professed their devotion to liberty in principle, \"it appeared to mean whatever\nthose in power wanted.\"[164] For example, the liberties specified in the Rights of Man were limited by law\nwhen they might \"cause harm to others, or be abused\". Prior to 1792, Jacobins and others frequently\noppos ed press restrictions on the grounds  these violated a basic right.[165] However, the radical National\nConve ntion passed laws in September 1793 and July 1794 imposing the death penalty for offences such as\n\"disparaging the National Conve ntion\", and \"misleading publ ic opinion.\"[166]\nWhile revolutionaries also endorsed the principle of equality, few advoc ated equality of wealth since\nproperty was also viewed as a right.[167] The National Assembly oppos ed equal political rights for\nwomen,[168] while the abolition of slavery in the colonies was delayed until February 1794 because it\nconflicted with the property rights of slave owners, and many feared it would disrupt trade.[169] Political\nequality for male citizens was another divisive issue, with the 1791 c onstitution limiting the right to vot e and\nstand for office to males over 25 who met a property qualification, so-called \"active citizens\". This\nrestriction w as oppos ed by m any activists, including R obespierre, the Jacobins, and C ordeliers.[170]\nThe principle that sovereignty resided in the nation was a key concept of the Revolution.[171] However,\nIsrael argues this obscures ideological differences over whether the will of the nation was best expressed\nthrough representative assemblies and constitutions, or direct action by revolutionary crowds, and popul ar\nassemblies such as the sections of the Paris commune.[172] Many considered constitutional monarchy asRole of ideology", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3919, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc3d926d-1673-4f05-aa4e-7aeff6b0cab9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc3d926d-1673-4f05-aa4e-7aeff6b0cab9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3d3278e-de54-4d5a-b9ad-f184441bd419", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "05f7562b573c064e89815403305e731297110ce0654d1126165b8aeca840003d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "697c236f-ce37-4ec9-8fed-f1b74aec926d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "b2987fdccdd426193db5b12d1c63ea232ed38417f6bfa6d524cca1e1ee60bd33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b37b9dad-3aba-488a-a263-fb8d9ea6b668", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d336ec56fc08d7d94ef01650d3e27f61e6544364c2df44329bcc2c1bf5a972e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "French victory at the Battle of Valmy\non 20 September 1792 validated the\nRevolutionary idea of armies\ncomposed of citizensincompatible with the principle of popul ar sovereignty,[173] but prior to 1792, there was a strong bloc with\nan ideological commitment to such a system, based on the writings of Hobbe s, Locke, Montesquieu and\nVoltaire.[174]\nIsrael argues the nationalisation of church property and the establishment of the Constitutional Church\nreflected an ideological commitment to secularism, and a determination to unde rmine a bastion of old\nregime privilege.[175] While Cobba n agrees the Constitutional Church was motivated by ideology, he sees\nits origins in the anti-clericalism of Voltaire and ot her Enlightenment figures.[176]\nJacobins were hostile to formal political parties and factions which they saw as a threat to national unity and\nthe general will, with \"political virtue\" and \"love of country\" key elements of their ideology.[177][178] They\nviewed the ideal revolutionary as selfless, sincere, free of political ambition, and devoted to the nation.[179]\nThe disputes leading to the departure first of the Feuillants, then later the Girondists, were conduc ted in\nterms of the relative political virtue and patriotism of the disputants. In December 1793, all members of the\nJacobin clubs were subject to a \"purifying scrutiny\", to determine whether they were \"men of virtue\".[180]\nThe Revolution initiated a series of conflicts that began in 1792 and\nended only with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. In its early\nstages, this seemed unlikely; the 1791  Constitution specifically\ndisavowed \"war for the purpose of conque st\", and although\ntraditional tensions between France and Austria re-emerged in the\n1780s , Emperor Joseph II cautiously welcomed the reforms. Austria\nwas at war with the Ottomans, as were the Russians, while both\nwere negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland. Most\nimportantly, Britain preferred peace, and as Emperor Leopold II\nstated after the Declaration of Pillnitz, \"without England, there is no\ncase\".[181]\nIn late 1791, factions within the Assembly came to see war as a\nway to unite the country and secure the Revolution by eliminating hostile forces on its borders and\nestablishing its \"natural frontiers\".[182] France declared war on Austria in April 1792 and issued the first\nconscription orders, with recruits serving for twelve months. By the time peace finally came in 1815, the\nconflict had involved every major European power as well as the United States, redrawn the map of Europe\nand expanded into the Americas, the Middle East, and the Indian Ocean.[183]\nFrom 1701 to 1801, the popul ation of Europe grew from 118 to 187 million; combined with new mass\nproduc tion techniques, this allowed belligerents to suppor t large armies, requiring the mobilisation of\nnational resources. It was a different kind of war, fought  by nations rather than kings, intended to destroy\ntheir oppone nts' ability to resist, but also to implement deep-ranging social change. While all wars are\npolitical to some degree, this period was remarkable for the emphasis placed on reshaping bounda ries and\nthe creation of  entirely new European states.[184]\nIn April 1792, French armies invaded the Austrian Netherlands but suffered a series of setbacks before\nvictory over an Austrian-Prussian army at Valmy in September. After defeating a second Austrian army at\nJemappes on 6 November, they occupied the Netherlands, areas of the Rhineland, Nice and Savoy.\nEmboldened by this success, in February 1793 France declared war on the Dutch Republic, Spain and\nBritain, beginning the War of the First Coalition.[185] However, the expiration of the 12-month term for the\n1792 recruits forced the French to relinquish their conque sts.

Leading soldiers like Hoche, Pichegru and Carnot\nwielded significant political influence and often set policy; Campo Formio was approved by Bonaparte, not\nthe Directory, which strongly obj ected to terms it considered too lenient.[189]\nDespite these concerns, the Directory never developed a realistic peace programme, fearing the destabilising\neffects of peace and the consequent demobilisation of hundr eds of thous ands of young men. As long as the\ngenerals and their armies stayed away from Paris, they were happy t o allow them to continue fighting, a  key\nfactor behind sanctioning Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt. This resulted in aggressive and oppor tunistic\npolicies, leading to the War of the Second C oalition in November 1798.[190]\nIn 1789, the most popul ous French colonies were Saint-Domingue\n(today Haiti), Martinique, Guadeloupe , the \u00cele Bourbon (R\u00e9union)\nand the \u00cele de la France. These colonies produc ed commodities\nsuch as sugar, coffee and cotton for exclusive export to France.\nThere were about 700,000 slaves in the colonies, of which about\n500,000 were in Saint-Domingue .

The assemblies refused to\nimplement the decree and fighting br oke out between the coloured popul ation of  Saint-Domingue  and w hite\ncolonists, each side recruiting slaves to their forces. A major slave revolt followed in Augus t.[196]\nIn March 1792, the Legislative Assembly responde d to the revolt by granting citizenship to all free\ncoloureds and sending two commissioners, Sonthona x and Polv\u00e9rel, and 6,000 t roops to Saint-Domingue  to\nenforce the decree. On arrival in September, the commissioners announc ed that slavery would remain in\nforce. Over 72,00 s laves were still in revolt, mostly in the north.[197]\nBrissot and his suppor ters envisaged an eventual abolition of slavery but their immediate concern was\nsecuring trade and the suppor t of merchants for the revolutionary wars. After Brissot's fall, the new\nconstitution of June 1793 included a new Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but excluded\nthe colonies from its provisions. In any event, the new constitution was suspended until France was at\npeace.[198]\nIn early 1793, royalist planters from Guadeloupe  and Saint-Domingue  formed an alliance with Britain. The\nSpanish supported insurgent slaves, led by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Papillon and Georges Biassou, in the north of\nSaint-Domingue . White planters loyal to the republic sent representatives to Paris to convince the Jacobin\ncontrolled Conve ntion that those calling for the abolition of slavery were British agents and suppor ters of\nBrissot, hopi ng to disrupt trade.[199]\nIn June, the commissioners in Saint-Domingue  freed 10,000 slaves fighting for the republic. As the royalists\nand their British and Spanish suppor ters were also offering freedom for slaves willing to fight for their\ncause, the commissioners outbid them by abolishing slavery in the north in August, and throughout  the\ncolony in October. Representatives were sent to Paris to gain the approval of the conve ntion for the\ndecision.[199][200]\nThe Conve ntion voted for the abolition of slavery in the colonies on 4 February 1794 and decreed that all\nresidents of the colonies had the full rights of French citizens irrespective of colour.[201] An army of 1,000\nsans-culottes led by Victor Hugues was sent to Guadeloupe  to expel the British and enforce the decree. The\narmy recruited former slaves and eventually numbered 11,000, capturing Guadeloupe  and other smaller\nislands. Abolition was also proclaimed on Guyane. Martinique remained unde r British occupation, while\ncolonial landow ners in R\u00e9union and the \u00celes Mascareignes repulsed the republicans.[202] Black armies\ndrove the Spanish out  of Saint-Domingue  in 1795, a nd the last of the British withdrew in 1798.[203]\nIn republican controlled areas from 1793 to 1799, freed slaves were required to work on their former\nplantations or for their former masters if they were in domestic service. They were paid a wage and gained\nproperty rights. Black and coloured generals were effectively in control of large areas of Guadeloupe  and\nSaint-Domingue , including Toussaint Louve rture in the north of Saint-Domingue , and Andr\u00e9 Rigaud in the\nsouth. Historian Fr\u00e9deric R\u00e9gent states that the restrictions on the freedom of employment and movement of\nformer slaves meant that, \"only whites, persons of color already freed before the decree, and former slaves\nin the army or on w arships really benefited from general emancipation.\"[202]\nMedia and symbolism\nNewspapers", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3810, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74494e39-f08a-4468-a5c1-edd96b034b3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "74494e39-f08a-4468-a5c1-edd96b034b3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d0c49a9-2167-40b6-a52c-9497d34904af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "11696635c048e6f166502f84760e7264d0e2265efdcdd8be7251df22ba6ec9f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "00ad354c-8295-4e33-9814-5cf225b42143", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "9c52f54f5af18de760275a66e902becc88649a765b36b2110fb617a19cd089eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7eddab5d-460c-47ec-9d32-b80d3f7c01f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa37acb6d251a59903b14c9fa6a9d8f1178b3a3f93aed823c2f95b698c2f6533", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A copy of L'Ami du peuple\nstained with the blood of\nMarat\nMarche des Marseillois, 1792,\nsatirical etching, London[209]Newspapers and pamphlets played a central role in stimulating and\ndefining the Revolution.

There was a widespread assumption that writing was a vocation,\nnot a business, and the role of the press was the advancement of civic republicanism.[206] By 1793 the\nradicals were most active but initially the royalists floode d the country with their publication the \"L'Ami du\nRoi\" (Friends of the King) until they were suppressed.[207]\nTo illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement\na new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbols. To this end,\nsymbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either\ndestroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a\nnew sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.[208]\nLa Marseillaise\nThe French national anthem La Marseillaise; text in French.\nProblems playing this file?

The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red\ncockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on\nthe city's coat of arms.

Historian Fran\u00e7ois Aulard wrote:\n\"From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called\nthe feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property,\nthe abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of\nlife.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for\nit aimed at benefiting all hum anity.\"[233]\nThe revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church,\nalthough the two institutions survived. Hanson sugge sts the French underwent a funda mental\ntransformation in self-identity, evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by intrinsic\nhuman rights.[234] After the collapse of the First French Empire in 1815, the French public lost many of the\nrights and privileges earned since the revolution, but remembered the participatory politics that characterised\nthe period. According to Paul Hanson, \"Revolution became a tradition, and republicanism an enduring\noption.\"[235]\nThe Revolution meant an end to arbitrary royal rule and held out the promise of rule by law unde r a\nconstitutional order. Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system and the restored Bourbons were\nforced to retain one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871, the French Third Republic was launched\nwith a deep commitment to uphol ding the ideals of the Revolution.[236][237] The Vichy regime (1940\u2013\n1944) , tried to undo the revolutionary heritage, but retained the republic. However, there were no efforts by\nthe Bourbons , Vichy or any other gove rnment to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the\nnobility in 1789. F rance permanently became a society of equals unde r the law.[235]\nAgriculture was transformed by the Revolution. With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church\nand the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms.\nHarvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues. Primogeniture was ended both for nobles\nand peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch, and led to a fall in the birth rate since all children had\na share in the family property.[238] Cobba n argues the Revolution bequeathed to the nation \"a ruling class\nof landow ners.\"[239]Impact\nFrance", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3427, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "380b5a71-ebf6-4efc-8015-59c282e45ed3": {"__data__": {"id_": "380b5a71-ebf6-4efc-8015-59c282e45ed3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29898f9a-87b2-41a6-9a1c-a6881bc8face", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "7dbfbde8d307ebeadbc7b18939bc36da07a4da3a19a66435e24f66c7abddf2e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2ee0291-259f-4ebf-a802-7c87fc0bd91f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "0f8e3d318599d75f302599ae30e63861ee600fb56a188b2af9aa747934d439ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e904a1ac-ed0f-43d2-b56b-94ce951001b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a400b1fe4c2b2a2f141b43765a6180b4df72415adb3fe9ca9bcbe7723b0972c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Econom ic historians are divided on the econom ic impact of the Revolution.

Edmund Burke responde d in\nNovember 1790 with his own pamphlet, Reflections on the Revolution in France, attacking the French\nRevolution as a threat to the aristocracy of all countries.[245][246] William Coxe oppos ed Price's premise\nthat one's country is principles and pe ople, not the State itself.[247]\nConve rsely, two seminal political pieces of political history were written in Price's favour, suppor ting the\ngeneral right of the French people to replace their State. One of the first of these \"pamphlets\" into print was\nA Vindication of the Rights of Men by Mary Wollstonecraft . Wollstonecraft's title was echoed by Thomas\nPaine's Rights of Man, published a few months later. In 1792 Christophe r Wyvill published Defence of Dr.\nPrice and the Reformers of England, a plea for reform and moderation.[248] This exchange of ideas has\nbeen described as \"one of the great political debates in British history\".[249]\nIn Ireland, the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some\nautonom y into a mass movement led by the Society of United Irishmen involving Catholics and Protestants.\nIt stimulated the demand for further reform throughout  Ireland, especially in Ulster. The upshot was a revolt\nin 1798, l ed by Wolfe Tone, that was crushed by B ritain.[250]\nGerman reaction to the Revolution swung from favourable to antagonistic. At first it brought  liberal and\ndemocratic ideas, the end of guilds, serfdom and the Jewish ghetto. It brought  econom ic freedoms and\nagrarian and legal reform. Above  all the antagonism helped stimulate and shape German nationalism.[251]\nFrance invaded Switzerland and turned it into the \"Helvetic Republic\" (1798\u20131 803), a French puppe t state.\nFrench interference with localism and traditions was deeply resented in Switzerland, although some reforms\ntook hol d and survived in the later period of  restoration.[252][253]Europe outside France", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e904a1ac-ed0f-43d2-b56b-94ce951001b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e904a1ac-ed0f-43d2-b56b-94ce951001b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d2444d3-3bce-4dcf-b743-d4404fa0a145", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "49f0e2fd079f15c2267a956d024dfa30e492d9be57f04d50466e786b65e4fed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "380b5a71-ebf6-4efc-8015-59c282e45ed3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "7dbfbde8d307ebeadbc7b18939bc36da07a4da3a19a66435e24f66c7abddf2e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef72f286-d885-4093-bd6b-5a4c9f9903fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6643f0ea882e369edcc1ac480d6fea4a012ddb25e1160fb4300b3e5cc1ab3b41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "During the Revolutionary Wars, the French invaded and occupied the region now know n as Belgium\nbetween 1794 and 1814. The new gove rnment enforced reforms, incorporating the region into France.\nResistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppos e French rule. The French\nlegal system, how ever, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of  class distinctions.[254]\nThe Kingdom  of Denmark adopted liberalising reforms in line with those of the French Revolution. Reform\nwas gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism\nby creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organised\nliberals who di rected pol itical change in the first half of the 19th century.[255]\nThe Constitution of Norway of 1814 was inspired by the French Revolution,[256] and was considered to be\none of the most liberal and de mocratic constitutions at the time.[257]\nInitially, most people in the Province of Quebec were favourable toward the revolutionaries' aims. The\nRevolution took place against the background of an ongoi ng campaign for constitutional reform in the\ncolony by Loyalist emigrants from the United States.[258] Public opinion began to shift against the\nRevolution after the Flight to Varennes and further soured after the September Massacres and the\nsubsequent execution of Louis XVI.[259] French migration to the Canadas experienced a substantial decline\nduring and after the Revolution. Only a limited number of artisans, professionals, and religious emigres\nwere allowed to settle in the region during this period.[260] Most emigres settled in Montreal or Quebec\nCity.[260] The influx of religious emigres also revitalised the local Catholic Church, with exiled priests\nestablishing a num ber of parishes across the Canadas.[260]\nIn the United States, the French Revolution deeply polarised American politics, and this polarisation led to\nthe creation of the First Party System. In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the Democratic-Republican\nParty led by former American minister to France Thomas Jefferson favored revolutionary France and\npointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. George Washington and his unanimous cabinet, including\nJefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington proclaimed\nneutrality instead.[261]\nThe first writings on the French revolution were near contemporaneous with events and mainly divided\nalong ideological lines. These included Edmund Burke's conservative critique Reflections on the\nRevolution in France (1790)  and Thomas Paine's response Rights of Man (1791) .[262] From 1815, na rrative\nhistories dominated, often based on first-hand experience of the revolutionary years. By the mid-nineteenth\ncentury, more scholarly histories appeared, written by specialists and based on original documents and a\nmore critical assessment of contemporary accounts.[263]\nDupuy identifies three main strands in nineteenth century historiography of the Revolution. The first is\nrepresented by reactionary writers who rejected the revolutionary ideals of popul ar sovereignty, civil\nequality, and the promotion of rationality, progress and personal happiness over religious faith. The second\nstream is those writers who celebrated its democratic, and republican values. The third were liberals like\nGermaine de Sta\u00ebl and Guizot, who accepted the necessity of reforms establishing a constitution and the\nrights of man, but rejected state interference with private property and individual rights, even when\nsuppor ted by a  democratic majority.[264]North America\nHistoriography", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3694, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef72f286-d885-4093-bd6b-5a4c9f9903fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef72f286-d885-4093-bd6b-5a4c9f9903fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54b747a4-e752-4164-9146-c823bc6e81ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "caece2e1e5edf185e6dc65281ae29e90c06df4a2f0859e004a82569093210814", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e904a1ac-ed0f-43d2-b56b-94ce951001b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "49f0e2fd079f15c2267a956d024dfa30e492d9be57f04d50466e786b65e4fed2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e99e01b-4146-49c7-a65d-510183beceaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a82423a2a21a75c5899166a6d88b457fc14f6dac656ac0e776888d3bde1342c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hippolyte Taine, conservative\nhistorian of the French\nRevolution\nGeorges Lefebvre, Marxist historian\nof the French RevolutionJules Michelet was a leading 19th-century historian of the democratic\nrepublican strand, and Thiers, Mignet and Tocqueville were prominent in\nthe liberal strand.[265] Hippolyte Taine's Origins of Contemporary\nFrance (1875\u20131894)  was modern in its use of departmental archives, but\nDupuy sees him as reactionary, given his contempt for the crowd, and\nRevolutionary values.[266]\nThe broad distinction between\nconservative, democratic-\nrepublican and liberal\ninterpretations of the Revolution\npersisted in the 20th-century,\nalthough historiography became\nmore nuanced, with greater\nattention to critical analysis of\ndocumentary evidence.[266][267]\nAlphons e Aulard (1849\u20131928)\nwas the first professional historian of the Revolution; he promoted\ngraduate studies, scholarly editions, and learned journals.[268][269]\nHis major work, The French Revolution, a Political History, 1789\u2013\n1804  (1905), was a democratic and republican interpretation of the\nRevolution.[270]\nSocio-econom ic analysis and a focus on the experiences of ordinary\npeople dominated French studies of the Revolution from the 1930s .[271] Georges Lefebvre elaborated a\nMarxist socio-econom ic analysis of the revolution with detailed studies of peasants, the rural panic of 1789,\nand the behaviour of revolutionary crowds.[272][273] Albert Soboul, also writing in the Marxist-Republican\ntradition, publ ished a major study of  the sans-culottes in 1958.[274]\nAlfred Cobban challenged Jacobin-Marxist social and econom ic explanations of the revolution in two\nimportant works, The Myth of the French Revolution (1955)  and Social Interpretation of the French\nRevolution (1964) . He argued the Revolution was primarily a political conflict, which ended in a victory for\nconservative property ow ners, a result which retarded econom ic development.[275][276]\nIn their 1965 work, La Revolution fran\u00e7aise, Fran\u00e7ois Furet and Denis Richet also argued for the primacy\nof political decisions, contrasting the reformist period of 1789 to 1790 with the following interventions of\nthe urban masses which led to radicalisation and an ungove rnable situation.[277]\nFrom the 1990s , Western scholars largely abandone d Marxist interpretations of the revolution in terms of\nbourgeoisie-proletarian class struggle as anachronistic. However, no new explanatory model has gained\nwidespread suppor t.[232][278] The historiography of the Revolution has expanded into areas such as cultural\nand regional histories, visual representations, transnational interpretations, and de colonisation.[277]\nAge of Revolution\nBourgeois revolution\nCordeliers\nDemocracy in Europe\nGlossary of the French Revolution\nHistory of FranceSee also", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2793, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e99e01b-4146-49c7-a65d-510183beceaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e99e01b-4146-49c7-a65d-510183beceaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c471b52-c6f5-423b-8283-ef6f618ecdf2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "160cf64313e7e2d17aae0f7967ab6699c40396e129cd098cde3e6a33439aa8ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef72f286-d885-4093-bd6b-5a4c9f9903fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/ai python agent/data/French_Revolution.pdf"}, "hash": "caece2e1e5edf185e6dc65281ae29e90c06df4a2f0859e004a82569093210814", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad82f5cf-0d53-4516-b333-fee8a2095ec8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9061b9fb0769f216a570dee1aac610e37e03d10c19d7f0ce87846910e0eb7198", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "List of people associated with the French Revolution\nList of political groups in the French Revolution\nList of films set during the French Revolution and French Revolutionary Wars\nMus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise\nParis in the 18th century\nTimeline of the French Revolution\na.
